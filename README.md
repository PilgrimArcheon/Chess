# Chess
This Chess Game made in Unity is a digital version of the classic board game that allows players to play against each other on a virtual chessboard. The game is designed with intuitive controls and realistic 3D graphics that recreate the look and feel of a traditional chess set.

Players can move pieces by clicking and dragging them to their desired location on the board, and the game enforces the rules of chess to ensure fair gameplay. The game also provides options for players to customize their playing experience, including the ability to select different chess sets, board designs, and difficulty levels.

In addition to playing against another human player, the game can also provide the option to play against a computer opponent, which can vary in difficulty based on the player's skill level. The game also tracks player statistics and provides a history of past games, making it easy for players to review their progress and improve their skills over time.
